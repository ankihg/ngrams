You knew in five minutes, 
But I knew in a sentence 
You knew in five minutes, 
But I knew in a sentence 

So why do we go through all of this again? 
Your eyes are flutterin' 
Such pretty wings. 
A moth, flyin' into the 
Same old flame again 
It never ends 

It's not like I dropped the bomb, 
on my conscience mom 
It takes fightin' day and night 
to make such a good thing die 

Out, everyone out 
I give too much shit at home 
In my heart and mind 
It gets me every time 

So why do we go 
Through all this shit again 
Your eyes are Flutterin' 
Such pretty wings. 
A moth flyin' into me 
The same old flame again 
It never ends

She's gone to sea 
She's fightin' for me 
What bravery! 

I'm sleeping in a battle ship 
I'm sleeping in a submarine 
I'm sleeping in a fighter plane 
I'm sleeping going down the drain 

All hands on deck! 

The radio adresss 
What a mess! 

A cage is a cage 
Is a cage, is a cage!
. 

Planes!
Ships!
Hey!
No cars go!
Hey!

No cars go, where we know!

Spaceships!
Subs!
Hey!
Us kids know!
Hey!
No Cars Go!
Where we know!

Between the click of the light and the start of the dream!
. 

I guess we'll have to move
The neighborhood is on to us

Let's join the little babe's
Throwin' rocks in front of us

Riding on my bicycle
I pass my sister on a bus
Let's take the country road before our parents send for us

Trees keep fallin' at my feet
I guess it's time to build a boat
Make a raft of our bodies
Do you think that it'll float?
What I said was not a joke,
But you just licked the envelope
I'm tired of dating, let's elope
But you just licked the envelope

Three cheers for my parents,
Lonely failed experiments!
Three cheers for my parents,
Lonely failed experiments!

Don't you dare blame my parents
I'm the only failed experiment
Don't you dare blame your parents
You're the only failed experiment
Don't you dare blame your grandparents
Mom's the only failed experiment
Don't you dare blame your grandparents
Dad's the only failed experiment
Don't blame God
Just blame God
Don't blame God
. 

I'll admit I'm full of shit
That's how I know I love you
That's how I know I trust you,
You're not sure if there's a right or wrong
But it feels like there is when I treat you like this
I go outside

Texas, I won't come home
Not even if you call
I can't hear you at all
I can't explain why it's a sin the state I'm living in
I just feel so tired
I go outside

My mouth is full, your heart is an apple
My mouth is full, your heart is an apple
Pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme

Please don't even call
I can't hear you at all
. 

The red lights mean you're leaving
The white one's mean returning
Tell me how this story ends
And I'll keep them fires burning

The headlights look like diamonds
The taillights burn like coals
Tell me how this story ends
Before the fires go cold

The countryside's deserted
There's no one on the farms
The suburbs all are sleeping
The earthquakes set off car alarms

All after all now we aware
All after all the time we share
There's so much fears of world,
Hopes of world, Tears of world
. 

You wanna be set apart?
Burn all of your art repair the wasteful part
I'm a vampire in a forest fire
Hey! we all gotta keep warm
driving towards the storm

Your father was a pervert
Face down in the dirt
He taught you how to hurt
My father was a miner who lived in the suburbs
Let's live in the suburbs
If I let where I'm from burn I can never return!

My brother reads you and me his new poetry
How embarassing
Your sister pours the gasoline
I'll fix your meals
while your burns heal!

Find a house you don't have to rebuild
Stone by stone, brick by brick, nail by nail my father never meant to leave me this
Let this love last
I drive too fast
Said I'd return if I'd ever cared
But there's no interstate I find to take me there
. 

And if the snow buries my...
My neighborhood

And if my parents are crying,
Then I'll dig a tunnel from my window to yours
Yeah, a tunnel from my window to yours

You climb out the chimney
And meet me in the middle
The middle of the town
And since there's no one else around,
We let our hair grow long and forget all we used to know
Then our skin gets thicker from living out in the snow

You change all the lead sleeping in my head
As the day grows dim, I hear you sing a golden hymn...

Then, we tried to name our babies
But we forgot all the names that,
The names we used to know
But sometimes,
We remember our bedrooms and our parent's bedrooms and the bedrooms of our friends
Then we think of our parents...
Well, whatever happened to them?!

You change all the lead sleeping in my head to gold
As the day grows dim, I hear you sing a golden hymn
It's the song I've been trying to sing...

Purify the colors, purify my mind
Purify the colors, purify my mind
And spread the ashes of the colors over this heart of mine!

Alexander, our older brother
Set out for a great adventure
He tore our images out of his pictures
He scratched our names out of all his letters

Our mother should've just named you Laika...

Come on, Alex. You can do it!
Come on, Alex. There's nothing to it!
If you want something, don't ask for nothing!
If you want nothing, don't ask for something!

Our mother should've just named you Laika...
It's for your own good
It's for the neighborhood...
The neighborhood!

Our older brother bit by a vampire
For a year, we caught his tears in a cup
And now we're gonna make him drink it
Come on, Alex. Don't die or dry up!

Our mother should've just named you Laika
It's for your own good
It's for the neighborhood...
The neighborhood!

When daddy comes home, you always start a fight
So the neighbors can dance in the police disco lights

The police disco lights
Now the neighbors can dance!
The police disco lights
Now the neighbors can dance!
. 

Hey! The streetlights all burnt out.
Une année sans lumière
Je monte un cheval
Qui porte des oeillères

Hey, my eyes are shooting sparks,
La nuit, mes yeux t'éclairent
Ne dis pas a ton père
Qu'il porte des oeillères

Hey, your old man should know,
If you see a shadow,
There's something there.

So hey! My eyes are shooting sparks,
La nuit, mes yeux t'éclairent
Ne dis pas a ton père
Qu'il porte des oeillères

Hey, your old man should know,
If you see a shadow,
There's something there.

Hey, give it to her.
She's in love, give her!
She's in love, come on give it to her!
Give it to her, come on give it to her!
Give it to her, come on give it to her!

I woke up with the power out
Not really something to shout about
Ice has covered up my parents hands
Don't have any dreams, don't have any plans

I went out into the night
I went out to find some light
Kids are swingin' from the power lines
Nobody's home, so nobody minds 

I woke up on the darkest night
Neighbors all were shoutin' that they found the light 
"We found the light!"
Shadows jumpin' all over my walls
Some of them big, some of them small

I went out into the night 
I went out to pick a fight with anyone
Light a candle for the kids
Jesus Christ don't keep it hid! 

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

Ice has covered up my parents hands
Don't have any dreams, don't have any plans
Growin' up in some strange storm
Nobody's cold, nobody's warm

I went out into the night
I went out to find some light
Kids are dyin' out in the snow, 
Look at them go, look at them go! 

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

And the power's out 
In the heart of man
Take it from your heart 
Put it in your hand

What's the plan? What's the plan? 

Is it a dream? Is it a lie? 
I think I'll let you decide
Just light a candle for the kids
Jesus Christ don't keep it hid! 

'Cause nothing's hid
From us kids
You ain't foolin' nobody 
With the lights out!

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

And the power's out
In the heart of man
Take it from your heart 
Put it in your hand

And there's something wrong 
In the heart of man
Take it from your heart
Put it in your hand

Where'd you go?!
. 

I am waitin' 'til I don't know when, 
cause I'm sure it's gonna happen then. 
Time keeps creepin' through the neighborhood, 
killing old folks, wakin' up babies 
just like we knew it would. 

All the neighbors are startin' up a fire, 
burning all the old folks the witches and the liars. 
My eyes are covered by the hands of my unborn kids, 
but my heart keeps watchin' 
through the skin of my eyelids. 

They say a watched pot won't ever boil, 
well I closed my eyes and nothin' changed, 
just some water getting hotter in the flames. 

It's not a lover I want no more, 
and it's not heaven I'm pining for, 
but there's some spirit I used to know, 
that's been drowned out by the radio! 

They say a watched pot won't ever boil, 
you can't raise a baby on motor oil, 
just like a seed down in the soil 
you gotta give it time
. 

They say it fades if you let it
Love was made to forget it 
I carved your name across my eyelids 
You pray for rain, I pray for blindness

If you still want me, please forgive me
The crown of love is falling from me. 
If you still want me, please forgive me 
Because the spark is not within me. 

I snuffed it out before my mom walked in my bedroom. 
The only thing that you keep changin' is your name
My love keeps growin' still the same 
Just like a cancer
And you won't give me a straight answer.
 
If you still want me, please forgive me 
The crown of love is falling from me. 
If you still want me, please forgive me 
Because your hands are not upon me. 

I shrugged them off before my mom walked in my bedroom. 
The pains of love
And they keep growin', 
In my heart there's flowers growin'
On the grave of our old love
Since you gave me a straight answer.
 
If you still want me, please forgive me
The crown of love is not upon me.
If you still want me, please forgive me,
Because the spark is not within me.
It's not within me.
It's not within me.
You gotta be the one,
You gotta be the way,
Your name is the only word that I can say!
You gotta be the one,
You gotta be the way,
Your name is the only word,
The only word that I can say!
Only word that I can say!
. 

Somethin’ filled up
my heart with nothin’.
Someone told me not to cry.

But now that I’m older,
my heart’s colder,
and I can see that it’s a lie.

Children, wake up.
Hold your mistake up
before they turn the summer into dust.

If the children don’t grow up,
our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up.
We’re just a million little gods causin' rain storms,
turnin’ every good thing to rust.

I guess we’ll just have to adjust.

With my lightnin’ bolts a glowin’,
I can see where I am goin’ to be
when the reaper he reaches and touches my hand.

With my lightnin’ bolts a glowin’,
I can see where I am goin’.
With my lightnin’ bolts a glowin’,
I can see where I am go -- goin’!

You better look out below!

Haïti, mon pays,
Wounded mother I'll never see
Ma famille set me free.
Throw my ashes into the sea.

Mes cousins jamais nés
Hantent les nuits de Duvalier.
Rien n'arrête nos esprits.
Guns can't kill what soldiers can't see.

In the forest we are hiding,
Unmarked graves where flowers grow.
Hear the soldiers angry yelling,
In the river we will go.

Tous les morts-nés forment une armée
Soon we will reclaim the earth.
All the tears and all the bodies
Bring about our second birth

Haïti, never free,
N'aie pas peur de sonner l'alarme.
Tes enfants sont partis,
In those days their blood was still warm.
. 

Sleeping is giving in
No matter what the time is
Sleeping is giving in
So lift those heavy eyelids
 
People say that you'll die
Faster than without water
But we know it's just a lie
Scare your son and scare your daughter
 
People say that your dreams are the only things that save ya
Come on baby in our dreams, we can live our misbehaviour

Every time you close your eyes (Lies, lies) [x4]
Every time you close your eyes [x4]

People try and hide the night
Underneath the covers
People try and hide the light
Underneath the covers
Come on hide your lovers, underneath the covers
Come on hide your lovers, underneath the covers
Hidin' from your brothers, underneath the covers
Come on hide your lovers underneath the covers

People say that you'll die 
Faster than without water
But we know it's just a lie
Scare your son and scare your daughter
Scare your son and scare your daughter
Scare your son and scare your daughter

Now here's the sun, it's alright! (Lies, lies)
Now here's the moon, it's alright! (Lies, lies)
Now here's the sun, it's alright! (Lies, lies)
Now here's the moon, it's alright! (Lies, lies)

Every time you close your eyes (Lies, lies) [x4]

Every time you close your eyes
Every time you close your eyes
Every time you close your eyes

I like the peace
In the backseat
I don't have to drive
I don't have to speak
I can watch the countryside
And I can fall asleep

My family tree's
Losing all its leaves
Crashing towards the driver's seat
The lightning bolt made enough heat 
To melt the street beneath your feet

Alice died
In the night
I've been learning to drive
My whole life
I've been learning

I like the peace
In the back-seat
I don't have to drive
I don't have to speak
I can watch the countryside

Alice died
In the night
I've been learning to drive
My whole life
I've been learning
. 

The night is long since you went away
I dream about you all through the day
My buddy, my buddy, no buddy quite so true.
(Hey that's a wrong note,
And that's a wrong note,
And tune up that G string,
And that's better, that's better, that's better)
Miss your voice, the touch of your hand
I long to know that you understand
My buddy, my buddy, your buddy misses you

Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June
We stood beneath an amber moon 
And softly whispered, "Someday soon"
We kissed and clung together

Then - tomorrow was another day
The morning found us miles away
With still a million things to say
And now, the twilight moves the skies above
Recalling thrills of our love
There's one thing I'm certain of
Return, I will, to old Brazil

Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June
We stood beneath an amber moon
And softly whispered, "Someday soon"
We kissed and clung together

Then - tomorrow was another day
The morning found us miles away
With still a million things to say
And now when twilight moves the skies above
Recalling thrills of our love 
There's one thing I'm certain of
Return, I will, to old Brazil

I walked down to the ocean
After waking from a nightmare
No moon, no pale reflection
Black Mirror, Black Mirror

Shot by a security camera
You can't watch your own image
And also look yourself in the eye
Black Mirror, Black Mirror, Black Mirror

I know a time is coming
All words will lose their meaning
Please show me something that isn't mine
But mine is the only kind that I relate to
Le miroir casse
The mirror casts mon reflet partour
Black Mirror, Black Mirror, Black Mirror

The black mirror knows no reflection
It knows not pride or vanity
It cares not about your dreams
It cares not for your pyramid schemes
Their names are never spoken
The curse is never broken
The curse is never broken

Un! Deux! Trois! Dis: Miroir Noir!
Black Mirror!
Un! Deux! Trois! Dis: Miroir Noir!
Black Mirror!

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Show me where them bombs will fall
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Show me where them bombs will fall

Black Mirror!
Black Mirror!
Black Mirror!

Every night my dream's the same
Same old city with a different name
Men are coming to take me away
I don't know why, but I know I can't stay

There's a weight that's pressing down
Late at night you can hear the sound
Even the noise you make when you sleep
Can't swim across a river so deep
They know my name cause I told it to them
But they don't know where and they don't know 
When it's coming, when it's coming

There's a fear I keep so deep
Knew its name since before I could speak
Aaaaah Aaaaah Aaaaah Aaaaah
They know my name cause I told it to them
But they don't know where and they don't know
When its coming, oh when but its coming

Keep the car running

If some night I don't come home
Please don't think I've left you alone
The same place animals go when they die
You can't climb across a mountain so high
The same city where I go when I sleep
You can't swim across a river so deep
They know my name cause I told it to them
But they don't know where
And they don't know
When it's coming, oh when is it coming?

Keep the car running
Keep the car running
Keep the car running
. 

A vial of hope and a vial of pain
In the light they both looked the same
Poured them out on into the world
On every boy and every girl

It's in the Neon Bible, the Neon Bible
Not much chance for survival
If the Neon Bible is right

Take the poison of your age
Don't lick your fingers when you turn the page
What I know is what you know is right
In the city it's the only light
It's the Neon Bible, the Neon Bible
Not much chance for survival
If the Neon Bible is right

Oh God! Well look at you now!
Oh! You lost it, but you don't know how!
In the light of a golden calf
Oh God! I had to laugh!

Take the poison of your age
Don't lick your fingers when you turn the page
It was wrong but you said it was right
In the future I will read at night

It's the Neon Bible, the Neon Bible
Not much chance for survival
If the Neon Bible is true

The king's taken back the throne
The useless seed is sown
When they say they're cutting off the phone
I tell 'em you're not home

No place to hide
You were fighting as a soldier on their side
You're still a soldier in your mind
Though nothing's on the line

You say it's money that we need
As if we're only mouths to feed
I know no matter what you say
There are some debts you'll never pay

Working for the Church while your family dies
You take what they give you and you keep it inside
Every spark of friendship and love will die without a home
Hear the soldier groan, "We'll go at it alone"

I can taste the fear
Lift me up and take me out of here
Don't wanna fight, don't wanna die
Just wanna hear you cry

Who's gonna throw the very first stone?
Oh! Who's gonna reset the bone?
Walking with your head in a sling
Wanna hear the soldier sing:
"Been working for the Church while my family dies
Your little baby sister's gonna lose her mind
Every spark of friendship and love will die without a home"
Hear the soldier groan "We'll go at it alone.

I can taste your fear
It's gonna lift you up and take you out of here
And the bone shall never heal
I care not if you kneel

We can't find you now
But they're gonna get the money back somehow
And when you finally disappear
We'll just say you were never here

Working for the church while your life falls apart
Singing halleluiah with the fear in your heart
Every spark of friendship and love will die without a home
Hear the soldier groan, "We'll go at it alone"
Hear the soldier groan, "We'll go at it alone"
. 

We can reach the sea
They won't follow me
Shadows they fear the sun
We'll make it if we run!

Run from the memory
Je nage, mais les sons me suivent

Left my name with the border guards
A name that I don't need
Ce sera un long voyage
Sur les vagues de l'oubli

Run from the memory
Je nage, mais les sons me suivent

Stop now before it's too late
Been eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate
Nothing lasts forever
That's the way it's gotta be
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea
For me

Stop now before it's too late 
Been eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate
Nothing lasts forever

Have you noticed he's been late
Nothing lasts forever

In an ocean of noise
I first heard your voice
Ringing like a bell
As if I had a choice, oh well!

Left in the morning
While you were fast asleep
Into an ocean of violence
A world of empty streets

You've got your reasons
And me I've got mine
But all the reasons I gave
Were just lies to buy myself some time

In an ocean of noise
I first heard your voice
Now who here among us
Still believes in choice?
Not I!

No way of knowing
What any man will do
An ocean of violence
Between me and you

You've got your reasons
And me I've got mine
But all the reasons I gave
Were just lies to buy myself some time

I'm gonna work it out
Cause time won't work it out
I'm gonna work it out
Cause time won't work it out for you
I'm gonna work it on out 
Cause time won't work it out for you
I'm gonna work it out
Cause time wont work it out
I'm gonna work it on out...

I'm serving time
All for a crime I did commit
You want the truth?
You know I'd do it all again
Left for dead
Heaven is only in my head!

I heard a voice
Calling from down inside the well
"See that silver shine?"
She said to come claim what was mine
So down I fell
Down into the water black
My prison cell
Only the moon was shining back!

If I seem lost, well I weighted the cost
And chose my crime
Now it's mine all mine!

I heard the voice
Calling from just outside the well
She said, "You fool, now that you know your end is near
You always fall for what you desire or what you fear!"

Resurrected
Living in a lighthouse
If you leave them ships are gonna wreck
Resurrected
Living in a lighthouse
The lions and the lambs ain't sleeping yet

Resurrected
Living in a lighthouse
Can you see the funny side, the ships are gonna wreck
Resurrected
Living in a lighthouse
The lions and the lambs ain't sleeping yet
The lions and the lambs ain't sleeping yet
The lions and the lambs ain't sleeping yet

I don't wanna work in a building downtown
No I don't wanna work in a building downtown
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Cause the planes keep crashing always two by two
I don't wanna work in a building downtown
No I don't wanna see when the planes hit the ground

I don't wanna work in a building downtown
I don't wanna work in a building downtown
Parking their cars in the underground
Their voices when they scream, well they make no sound
I wanna see the cities rust
And the troublemakers riding on the back of the bus

Dear God, I'm a good Christian man
In your glory, I know you understand
That you gotta work hard and you gotta get paid
My girl's 13 but she don't act her age
She can sing like a bird in a cage
O Lord, if you could see her when she's up on that stage!

You know that I'm a God-fearing man
You know that I'm a God-fearing man
But I just gotta know if it's part of your plan
To seat my daughters there by your right hand
I know that you'll do what's right, Lord
For they are the lanterns and you are the light

Now I'm overcome
By the light of day
My lips are near but my heart is far away
Tell me what to say
I'll be your mouthpiece!

Into the light of a bridge that burns 
As I drive from the city with the money that I earned
Into the black of a starless sky
I'm staring into nothing
and I'm asking you why
Lord, will you make her a star
So the world can see who you really are?

Little girl, you're old enough to understand
That you'll always be a stranger in a strange, strange land
The men are gonna come when you're fast asleep
So you better just stay close and hold onto me
If my little mocking bird don't sing
Then daddy won't buy her no diamond ring

Dear God, would you send me a child?
Oh! God, would you send me a child
Cause I wanna put it up on the TV screen
So the world can see what your true word means
Lord, would you send me a sign
Cause I just gotta know if I'm wasting my time!

Now I'm overcome
By the light of day
My lips are near but my heart is far away
Now the war is won
How come nothing tastes good?

You're such a sensitive child!
Oh! You're such a sensitive child!
I know you're tired but it's alright
I just need you to sing for me tonight
You're gonna have your day in the sun
You know God loves the sensitive ones

Oh! My little bird in a cage!
Oh! My little bird in a cage!
I need you to get up for me, up on that stage
And show the men that you're old for your age
Now ain't the time for fear
But if you don't take it, it'll disappear!

Oh! My little mocking bird sing!
Oh! My little mocking bird sing!
I need you to get up on that stage for me, honey
And show the men it's not about the money

Wanna hold a mirror up to the world
So that they can see themselves inside my little girl!

Do you know where I was at your age?
Any idea where I was at your age?
I was working downtown for the minimum wage
And I'm not gonna let you just throw it all away!
I'm through being cute, I'm through being nice
O tell me, Lord, am I the Antichrist?!

Don't wanna hear the noises on TV
Don't want the salesmen coming after me

Don't want it faster, I don't want it free
Don't wanna show you what they done to me
Don't wanna live in my father's house no more

Don't wanna fight in a holy war
Don't want the salesmen knocking at my door

MTV, what have you done to me?
Save my soul, set me free!
Set me free! What have you done to me?
I can't breathe! I can't see!
World War III, when are you coming for me?
Been kicking up sparks, we set the flames free
The windows are locked now so what'll it be?
A house on fire or a rising sea?

Why is the night so still?
Why did I take the pill?
Because I don't wanna see it at my windowsill

Don't wanna see it at my windowsill 
Don't wanna see it at my windowsill 
Don't wanna see it at my windowsill

We know a place where no planes go
We know a place where no ships go
Hey!
No cars go

We know a place where no subs go
Hey!
No cars go

No cars go

Go!
No go!

Between the click of the light and the start of the dream
Between the click of the light and the start of the dream

Little babies?
Let's go!

My body is a cage that keeps me
From dancing with the one I love
But my mind holds the key

My body is a cage that keeps me
From dancing with the one I love
But my mind holds the key

I'm standing on a stage
Of fear and self-doubt
It's a hollow play
But they'll clap anyway

My body is a cage that keeps me
From dancing with the one I love
But my mind holds the key

You're standing next to me
My mind holds the key

I'm living in an age
That calls darkness light
Though my language is dead
Still the shapes fill my head

I'm living in an age
Whose name I don't know
Though the fear keeps me moving
Still my heart beats so slow

My body is a cage that keeps me
From dancing with the one I love
But my mind holds the key

You're standing next to me
My mind holds the key
My body is a

My body is a cage
We take what we're given
Just because you've forgotten
That don't mean you're forgiven

I'm living in an age
That screams my name at night
But when I get to the doorway
There's no one in sight

I'm living in an age
That laughs
When I'm dancing
With the one I love
But my mind holds the key

You're standing next to me
My mind holds the key

Set my spirit free
Set my spirit free
Set my body free
Set my body free

Set my spirit free
Set my body free

In the suburbs I
I learned to drive
And you told me we'd never survive
Grab your mother's keys we're leavin'

You always seemed so sure
That one day we'd be fighting
In a suburban war
Your part of town against mine
I saw you standing on the opposite shore

But by the time the first bombs fell
We were already bored
We were already, already bored

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling again

Kids wanna be so hard
But in my dreams we're still screamin' and runnin' through the yard
And all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall
And all of the houses they built in the seventies finally fall
Meant nothin' at all
Meant nothin' at all
It meant nothin

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling and into the night

So can you understand?
Why I want a daughter while I'm still young
I wanna hold her hand
And show her some beauty
Before all this damage is done

But if it's too much to ask, it's too much to ask
Then send me a son

Under the overpass
In the parking lot we're still waiting
It's already past
So move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass
Cause it's already past
It's already, already past

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling again

I'm movin' past the feeling
I'm movin' past the feeling

In my dreams we're still screamin'
We're still screamin'
We're still screamin'

If the businessmen drink my blood
Like the kids in art school said they would
Then I guess I'll just begin again
You say, "can we still be friends? "

If I was scared... I would
And if I was bored... you know I would
And if I was yours... but I'm not

All the kids have always known
That the emperor wears no clothes
But they bow down to him anyway
'Cause it's better than being alone

If I was scared... I would
And if I was bored... you know I would
And if I was yours... but I'm not

Now you're knocking at my door
Saying please come out with us tonight
But I would rather be alone
Than pretend I feel alright

If the businessmen drink my blood
Like the kids in art school said they would
Then I guess I'll just begin again
You say, "can we still be friends? "

If I was scared... I would
And if I was pure... you know I would
And if I was yours... but I'm not

Now I'm ready to start

If I was scared... I would
And if I was pure... you know I would
And if I was yours... but I'm not

Now I'm ready to start

Now I'm ready to start
I would rather be wrong
Than live in the shadows of your song
My mind is open wide
And now I'm ready to start

Now I'm ready to start
My mind is open wide
And now I'm ready to start
You're not sure
You open the door
And step out into the dark

Now I'm ready
. 

So I wait my turn, I'm a modern man
And the people behind me, they can't understand
Makes me feel like
Makes me feel like

So I wait in line, I'm a modern man
And the people behind me, they can't understand
Makes me feel like
Something don't feel right

Like a record that's skipping
I'm a modern man
And the clock keeps ticking
I'm a modern man
Makes me feel like
Makes me feel like

In my dream I was almost there
Then they pulled me aside and said you're going nowhere
They say we are the chosen few
But we waste it
And that's why we're still waiting
On a number from the modern man
Maybe when you're older you will understand
Why you don't feel right
Why you can't sleep at night now

In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man

Oh I had a dream I was dreaming
And I feel I'm losing the feeling
Makes me feel like
Like something don't feel right
I erase the number of the modern man
Want to break the mirror of the modern man
Makes me feel like
Makes me feel like

In my dream I was almost there
Then they pulled me aside and said you're going nowhere
I know we are the chosen few
But we waste it
And that's why we're still waiting
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man

If it's alright
Then how come you can't sleep at night?
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man

I'm a modern man
I'm a modern man
I'm a modern man
I'm a modern man

Let's go downtown and watch the modern kids
Let's go downtown and talk to the modern kids
They will eat right out of your hand
Using great big words that they don't understand
They're singing:

Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo
Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo

They build it up just to burn it back down
They build it up just to burn it back down
The wind is blowing all the ashes around
Oh my dear God what is that horrible song they're singin'

Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo
Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo
Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo
Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo
Rococo, rococo!
Rococo!

They seem wild but they are so tame
They seem wild but they are so tame
They're moving towards you with their colors all the same
They want to own you but they don't know what game they're playing

Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo
Rococo!
Rococo!

(Rococo)
(Rococo)

Rococo!
Rococo!

(Rococo)
(Rococo)

Rococo!

Said your name, in an empty room
Said your name, in an empty room
Something I would never do

Said your name, in an empty room
Said your name, in an empty room
Something I would never do

I'm alone again

When I'm by myself
I can be myself
And my life is coming
But I don't know when

You were burning out, you're black and gray
You were burning out, you're black and gray
Something I would never say

I'm alone again

When I'm by myself
I can be myself
And my life is coming
But I don't know when

Toute ma vie, est avec toi
Toute ma vie, est avec toi
Moi j'attends, toi tu pars

Toute ma vie, est avec toi
Toute ma vie, est avec toi
Moi j'attends, toi tu pars

The summer that I broke my arm
I waited for your letter
I have no feeling for you now
Now that I know you better

I wish that I could have loved you then
Before our age was through
And before a world war does with us whatever it will do

Dreamt I drove home to Houston
On a highway that was underground
There was no light that we could see
As we listened to the sound
Of the engine failing

I feel like I've been living in
A city with no children in it
A garden left for ruin by a millionaire inside of a private prison

You never trust a millionaire quoting the sermon on the mount
I used to think I was not like them but I'm beginning to have my doubts
My doubts about it

When you're hiding underground
The rain can't get you wet
But do you think your righteousness could pay the interest on your debt?
I have my doubts about it

I feel like I've been living in
A city with no children in it
A garden left for ruin by a millionaire inside of a private prison

I feel like I've been living in
A city with no children in it
A garden left for ruin by and by as I hide inside of my private prison
. 

You told us that
We were too young
Now that night's closing in
And in the half light
We run
Lock us up safe
And hide the key
But the night tears us loose
And in the half light
We're free

Strange how the half light
Can make a place new
You can't recognize me
And I can't recognize you

We run through these streets
That we know so well
And the houses hide so much
But in the half light
None of us can tell
They hide the ocean in a shell
The ocean in a shell

Our heads are just houses
Without enough windows
You say you hear human voices
But they're only echoes

They're only echoes
They're only echoes
Only echoes

[x3:]
We are not asleep,
We are in the streets
. 

Now that San Francisco's gone,
I guess I'll just pack it in.
Wanna wash away my sins,
In the presence of my friends.

You and I we head back East,
To find a town where we can live.
Even in the half light,
We can see that something's gotta give.

When we watched the markets crash,
The promises we made were torn
Then my parents sent for me,
From out West where I was born.

Some people say, we've already lost,
But they're afraid to pay the cost for what we've lost.
Pay the cost for what we've lost

Now that you have left me here,
I will never raise my voice.
All the diamonds you have here,
In this home which has no life.

Oh, this city's changed so much
Since I was a little child.
Pray that God won't live to see
The death of everything that's wild.

Though we knew this day would come,
Still it took us by surprise.
In this town where I was born,
I now see through a dead man's eyes.

One day they will see it's long gone.
One day they will see it's long gone.
One day they will see it's long gone.
One day they will see it's long gone.
. 

Let's go for a drive
And see the town tonight
There's nothing to do but I don't mind when I'm with you

This time's so strange
They built it to change
And while we're sleeping all the streets, they rearrange.

And my old friends, we were so different then
Before your war against the suburbs began
Before it began

And now the music divides
Us into tribes
You grew your hair so I grew mine
You said the past won't rest
Until we jump the fence
And leave it behind

And my old friends, I can remember when
You cut your hair
I never saw you again
Now the cities we live in
Could be distant stars
And I search for you
In every passing car

The night's so warm
Yeah, the night's so warm
I've been living in the shadows of your song
Living in the shadows of your song

In the suburbs I,
I learned to drive
And you told me we would never survive
So grab your mother's keys we leave tonight

But you started a war
That you can't win
They keep erasing all the streets we grew up in

Now the music divides
Us into tribes
You choose your side and I'll choose my side

All my old friends, they don't know me now
Oh-oh
All my old friends, are staring through me now
Oh-oh
All my old friends, they don't know me now
All my old friends, they don't know me now

All my old friends wait
. 

One two three four!

Gonna make a record in the month of May
In the month of May, in the month of May
Gonna make a record in the month of May
When the violent wind blows the wires away

Month of May, it's a violent thing
In the city their hearts start to sing
Well, some people sing,
It sounds like they're screaming
Used to doubt it
But now I believe it

Month of May, everybody's in love
Then the city was hit from above
And just when I knew what I wanted to say
A violent wind blew the wires away

We were shocked in the suburbs

Now the kids are all standing with their arms folded tight
Kids are all standing with their arms folded tight
Well, some things are pure and some things are right
But the kids are still standing with their arms folded tight
I said some things are pure and some things are right
But the kids are still standing with their arms folded tight

So young, so young
So much pain for someone so young, well
I know it's heavy, I know it ain't light
But how you gonna lift it with your arms folded tight?

First the built the road, then they built the town
That's why we're still driving around
And around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around

Two-thousand nine, two-thousand ten
Wanna make a record how I felt then
When we stood outside in the month of May
And watched the violent wind blow the wires away

If I die in the month of May
Let the wind take my body away, yeah
I wish I may, I wish I might
Don't lay me down there with my arms folded tight

Start again in the month of May
Start again in the month of May
Come on and blow the wires away
Come on and blow the wires away

Start again in the month of May
Start again in the month of May
Come on and blow the wires away
Come on and blow the wires away

Start again in the month of May
Start again in the month of May
Come on and blow the wires away
Come on and blow the wires, the wires away

All those wasted hours we used to know
Spent the summer staring out the window
The wind it takes you where it wants to go

First they built the road, then they built the town
That's why we're still driving around and around
And all we see
Are kids in buses longing to be free

Wasted hours, before we knew
Where to go, and what to do
Wasted hours that you make new
And turn into
A life that we can live

Some cities make you lose your head
Endless suburbs stretched out thin and dead
And what was that line you said?

Wishing you were anywhere but here
You watch the life you're living disappear
And now I see
We're still kids in buses
Longing to be free

Wasted hours, before we knew
Where to go, and what to do
Wasted hours, that you make new
And turn into
A life that we can live
. 

Here
In my place and time
And here in my own skin
I can finally begin
Let the century pass me by
Standing under night sky
Tomorrow means nothing

I was only a child then
Feeling barely alive when
I heard a song from the speaker of a passing car
And prayed to a dying star
The memory's fading
I can almost remember singing
La la, la la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la

We watched the end of the century
Compressed on a tiny screen
A dead star collapsing and we could see
That something was ending
Are you through pretending
We saw the signs in the suburbs?

You could never predict it
That it could see through you
Kasparov - Deep Blue 1996
Your mind's playing tricks now
Show is over so take a bow
We're living in the shadows of...
La la, la la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la

La la, la la, la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la

Hey
Put the cellphone down for a while
In the night there is something wild
Can you hear it breathing?
And hey
Put the laptop down for a while
In the night there is something wild
I feel it, it's leaving me

La la, la la, la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la

I used to write
I used to write letters
I used to sign my name

I used to sleep at night
Before the flashing light settled deep in my brain

But by the time we met
By the time we met the times had already changed

So I never wrote a letter
I never took my true heart, I never wrote it down

So when the lights cut out
I was lost standing in the wilderness downtown

Now our lives are changing fast
Now our lives are changing fast
Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last

Now it seems strange
How we used to wait for letters to arrive
But what's stranger still
Is how something so small can keep you alive

We used to wait
We used to waste hours just walking around
We used to wait
All those wasted lives in the wilderness downtown

We used to wait
We used to wait
We used to wait
Sometimes it never came
We used to wait
Sometimes it never came
We used to wait
I'm still moving through the pain

I'm gonna write
A letter to my true love
I'm gonna sign my name

Like a patient on a table
I wanna walk again
Gonna move through the pain

Now our lives are changing fast
Now our lives are changing fast
Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last

We used to wait
We used to wait
We used to wait
Sometimes it never came
We used to wait
Sometimes it never came
We used to wait
I'm still moving through the pain
We used to wait
We used to wait
We used to wait

We used to wait for it
We used to wait for it
Now they're screaming "sing the chorus again! "

We used to wait for it.
We used to wait for it.
Now we're screaming "sing the chorus again! "

I used to wait for it
I used to wait for it
Hear my voice screaming "sing the chorus again! "

Wait for it!
Wait for it!
Wait for it!

Took a drive into the sprawl
To find the house where we used to stay
Couldn't read the number in the dark
You said let's save it for another day

Took a drive into the sprawl
To find the places we used to play
It was the loneliest day of my life
You're talking at me but I'm still far away

Let's take a drive
Through the sprawl
Through these towns they built to change
Then you said, the emotions are dead
It's no wonder that you feel so strange

Cops shone their lights
On the reflectors of our bikes
Said, do you kids know what time it is?
Well sir, it's the first time I've felt like something is mine
Like I have something to give
The last defender of the sprawl
Said, well where do you kids live?
Well sir, if you only knew
What the answer is worth
Been searching every corner
Of the earth
. 

They heard me singing and they told me to stop
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock
These days my life, I feel it has no purpose
But late at night the feelings swim to the surface

'Cause on the surface the city lights shine
They're calling at me, come and find your kind
Sometimes I wonder if the World's so small
That we can never get away from the sprawl
Living in the sprawl
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
And there's no end in sight
I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights

We rode our bikes to the nearest park
Sat under the swings and kissed in the dark
We shield our eyes from the police lights
We run away, but we don't know why
Black river, your city lights shine
They're screaming at us, we don't need your kind
Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small
That we can never get away from the sprawl
Living in the sprawl
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
And there's no end in sight
I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights

They heard me singing and they told me to stop
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock
Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small
Can we ever get away from the sprawl?
Living in the sprawl
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
And there's no end in sight
I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights
I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights
. 

If I could have it back
All the time that we wasted
I'd only waste it again
If I could have it back
You know I'd love to waste it again
Waste it again and again and again

I've got to ask
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again
Sometimes I can't believe it...

Now the future's staring at me
like a vision from the past,
and I know these crumbs they sold me,
they're never gonna last.
Though we know the culture war,
we don't know what it's for but
we've lived the southern strategy.
You know it's never gonna last,
so keep it in the past.

These are different times that we're living in.
These are different times.
Now the kids are growing up so fast.
Paying for our crimes.

You left while I was sleepin'.
You said, "It's down to me".
Oh I've read a little Bible.
You see what you want to see.
Oh, we know the culture war,
we don't know what it's for but
we've lived your southern strategy.
You know it's never gonna last
so keep that shit in the past.

These are different times that we're living in.
'Cause these are different times.
Now the kids are growing up so fast.
They're paying for our crimes.

The dominos they never fell
but bodies they still burn.
Throw my hand into the fire
but still I never learn,
will I ever learn?

That these are different times.
Now the kids are growing up so fast
and paying for our crimes.
We'll be soldiers for you, mommy and daddy,
in your culture war.
We'll be soldiers for you, mommy and daddy,
but we don't know what it's for.

We're soldiers now in the culture war.
We're soldiers now, but we don't know what it's for.
We're soldiers now in the culture war.
We're soldiers now, but we don't know what it's for.
So tell me what's it for.

You want it? You got it, here's your culture war.
You want it? Now you've got it, so tell me what's it for.

Hypocrite reader,
My double, my brother

Your daddy really took it out of you

But did he speak it in tongues?
But did he speak it in tongues?

Sneaking out the windows now

You've got the spirit now

Hypocrite reader,
My double, my brother

Where did we lose our way?

It's like we're speaking in tongues
It's like we're speaking in tongues

Sneaking out the windows now

You've got the spirit now

Now I can't understand a word

Now you're speaking in tongues

Trapped in a prison,
in a prism of light.
Alone in the darkness, 
a darkness of white.
We fell in love, 
alone on a stage,
in the reflective age.

Entre la nuit, la nuit et l'aurore.
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts.
[Translation: "Between the night, the night and the dawn. Between the realm of the living and the dead."]

If this is heaven,
I don't know what it's for.
If I can't find you there,
I don't care.

I thought I found a way to enter;
it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)
I thought I found the connector;
it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)

Now the signals we send
are deflected again.
We're so connected, 
but are we even friends? 

We fell in love when I was 19,
and now we're staring at a screen.

Entre la nuit, la nuit et l'aurore.
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts.

If this is heaven,
I need something more.
Just a place to be alone,
cause you're my home.

I thought I found a way to enter;
it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)
I thought I found the connector;
it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)
Just a reflector.

It's just a reflector, just a reflector.
It's just a reflector, just a reflector.
Just a reflector, reflector.

Just a reflector. [repeat x 7]

Just a reflection of a reflection
of a reflection of a reflection of a reflection (ah!),
but I see you on the other side.
We all got things to hide.

Just a reflection of a reflection
of a reflection of a reflection of a reflection (ah!),
but I see you on the other side.
We all got things to hide.

(Alright let's go back.)

Our song it skips
on little silver disks.
Our love is plastic, 
and they break it to bits.

I want to break free, 
but will they break me
down, down down,
don't mess around.

I thought I found a way to enter;
it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)
I thought I found the connector;
it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)

It's just a reflector. [repeat]

Thought you were praying to the resurrector;
turns out it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector;
turns out it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector;
turns out it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)

Just a reflector.

But I see you on the other side.

Just a reflector.

(Ah!)

But I see you on the other side. (Reflector)
We all got things to hide. (Reflector)

Just a reflector.

But I see you on the other side.

They're walking around
Head full of sound
Acting like
We don't exist
They walk in the room
And stare right through you
Talking like
We don't exist
But we exist

Daddy it's true
I'm different from you
But tell me why they treat me like this?
If you turned away
What would I say?
Not the first betrayed by a kiss

Maybe it's true
They're staring at you
When you walk in the room
Tell 'em it's fine
Stare if you like
Just let us through
Just let us through
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

They're down on their knees
Begging us please
Praying that we don't exist
Daddy it's fine
I'm used to 'em now
But tell me why they treat me like this?
It's cause we do it like this

Maybe it's true
They're staring at you
When you walk in the room
Tell 'em it's fine
Stare if you like
Just let us through
Just let us through
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

Let 'em stare, let 'em stare!
If that's all they can do!
But I'd lose my heart
If I turn away from you

Oh Daddy don't turn away
You know that I'm so scared
But will you watch me drown?
You know we're going nowhere
We know that we're young
And no shit we're confused
But will you watch us drown?
What are you so afraid to lose?

Down on my knees
Begging us please
Praying that we don't exist
You're down on your knees
Begging us please
Praying that we don't exist

But we exist
We exist
We exist
We exist
Maybe if you hang together
You can make the changes in our hearts
And if you hang together, you can change us
Just where should you start?

[Verse]
What if the camera
Really do
Take your soul
Oh no
What if the camera
Really do
Take your soul
Oh no

[Chorus]
Hit me with your flashbulb eyes!
Hit me with your flashbulb eyes!
You know I've got nothing to hide
You know I got nothing
No I got... nothing

[Verse]

[Chorus x2]

When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down you head inside
'Cause the lights don't work
Yeah nothing works they say you don't mind
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time

And the missionaries
They tell us we will be left behind
Been left behind
A thousand times, a thousand times

If you want to be righteous
If you want to be righteous, get in line
'Cause here comes the night time

Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night
Here comes the night time
Look out, here comes the night time!

They say, heaven's a place
Yeah, heaven's a place and they know where it is
But you know where it is?
It's behind the gate, they won't let you in
And when they hear the beat, coming from the street, they lock the door
But if there's no music up in heaven, then what's it for?

When I hear the beat, my spirit's on me like a live-wire
A thousand horses running wild in a city on fire
But it starts in your feet, then it goes to your head
If you can't feel it, then the roots are dead
And if you're the judge, then what is our crime?
Here comes the night time

Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time

Here comes the night!
Here comes the night!
Look out, here comes the night!
Here comes the night!
Here comes the night!
Here comes the night, the night, the night, the night time!

Now the preachers they talk
Up on the satellite
If you're looking for Hell, just try looking inside

Here comes the night time, the night time
Here comes the night time, the night time
Here comes the night time, the night time
Here comes the night time, the night time
Here comes the night time, the night time

When you look in the sky, just try looking inside
God knows what you might find
When you look in the sky, just try looking inside
God knows what you might find
Here comes the night time

Oh man
Do you like Rock and Roll music?
‘Cause I don’t know if I do

Is anything as strange as a normal person?
Is anyone as cruel as a normal person?
Waiting after school for you
They want to know if you
If you're normal too
Well, are you?
Are you?

I'm so confused. Am I a normal person?
You know, I can't tell if I'm a normal person
It's true, I think I'm cool enough, but am I cruel enough?
Am I cruel enough for you?

And they will break you down
Till everything is normal now
I know
And they will break you down
Till everything is normal now
I know

They take their tea at two
All the normal people, they do
They burn the jungle down
While they were sleeping, it grew
You dream in English now
In proper English, look how
You're just the same as me
It's through

And they will break you down
Till everything is normal now
I know
And they will break you down
Till everyone is normal now
I know

If that's what's normal now
I don't want to know
If that's what's normal now
Mama don't make me go

When they get excited, they try to hide it
Look at those normals go
When they get excited, they try to hide it
Look at those normals go
When they get excited, they try to hide it
Look at those normals go
When they get excited, they try to hide it... No!

And they will break you down
Till everything is normal now
I know
And they will break you down
Till everyone is normal now
I know

If that's what's normal now
I don't want to know
If that's what's normal now

Maybe if you hang together
You can make the changes in our hearts
And if you hang together
You can change us, just where should you start?

I've never really ever met a normal person
I've never really ever met a normal person
I've never really ever met a normal person
I've never really ever met a normal person... like you!
How do you do?
How do you do?

[Verse 1]
Sometimes it moves so fast
Sometimes it moves so fast
If you stop to ask
It's already passed
So how can you move so slow?
How can you move so slow?
You miss it if you don't
You miss it if you

[Chorus]
Don't already know
Already know
Already know
Already know
Already know

[Verse 2]
When your love is right
When your love is right
You can't sleep at night
You've been sleeping just fine
But when your love is bad
When your love is bad
I don't know why you're so sad
But it's time to go

[Chorus]
You already know
Already know
You already know
You already know
You already know
You already know

[Verse 3]
Sometimes it moves so fast
Sometimes it moves so fast
If you stop to ask

So how can you move so slow?
How can you move so slow?
You missed it, you know

[Chorus]
You already know

[Bridge]
Please stop wondering why you feel so bad
When you already know
(Already know)
Please stop wondering why you feel so sad
When you already know
(Already know)
Please stop wondering why you feel so bad
When you already know
(Already know)
Please stop wondering why you feel so sad

[Outro]
You already know
Oh, it's time to go

She said
"Well how do I know
When I know
When I know?"
(You already know)

Well then he said
"Well how do I know
When I know
When I know?"
(You already know)

She said
"Well how do I know

Haha, haha
Arcade Fire, ladies and gentlemen!
. 

You're the one that they used to hate
But they like you now
And everything that goes away
Will be returned somehow
They're the ones that spit on you
Cause they got no heart
I'm the one that will follow you
You're my Joan of Arc

Joan of Arc

You had a vision they couldn't see so
They put you down
But everything that you said would happen
It came around
And they're the ones that put you down
Cause they got no heart
But I'm the one that will follow you
You're my Joan of Arc

[Chorus 1]
Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc)
Tell the boys their time is through
Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, ah ooh)
Tell the boys I'll follow you
I'll follow you

Now they tell you that you're their muse
Yeah, they're so inspired
But where were they when they called your name
And they lit the fire?
When the voices came, you cut your hair
But you're still confused
But I'm the one with a heavy heart
Cause I'll follow you

[Chorus 2]
My Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, ah ooh)
Tell the boys their time is through
Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, ah ooh)
Tell the boys I'll follow you
Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, ah ooh)
When the boys are over you
Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, ah ooh)
Tell the boys I'll follow you
I'll follow you

I really wanna know you

[Regine Chassagne]
Tu dis que tu es mon juge
Mais je ne te crois pas
Alors tu dis que je suis une sainte
Mais ce n'est pas moi
J'entends des voix
Mais ce n'est pas moi
Je ne suis pas Jeanne d'Arc
And if you shoot you better hit your mark

[Chorus 2]

Joan, it's true
I only wanna know you
Joan, it's true, it's true
I only wanna know you
But Joan
I only wanna know you

First they love you
Then they kill you
Then they love you again
And then they love you
Then they kill you
Then they love you again
Love love love you
Kill kill kill you
And then they love you again
They love love love you
Kill kill kill you
And then they love you again

Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time

I hurt myself again
Along with all my friends
Feels like it never ends
Here comes the night again

Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
 
You hurt yourself again
Along with all your friends
Feels like it never ends
Here comes the night again

Here comes the night time 
Coming on slow
Here comes the night time
I know that you know

Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time

I hurt myself again
Along with all my friends
Feels like it never ends
Here comes the night again

You and I were born in a little town
Before the awful sound started coming down
Oh no, oh

You came home from school and knew you had to run
Please stop running now, just let me be the one for you
I know you can see things that we can't see
But when I say I love you, your silence covers me
Oh, Eurydice, it's an awful sound

I was so disappointed you didn't want me
Oh, how could it be, Eurydice?
I was standing beside you by a frozen sea
Will you ever get free?

Just take all your pain, just put it on me
So that you can breathe
When you fly away will you hit the ground?
It's an awful sound

I know there's a way, we can make them pay
Think it over and say, "I'm never going back again"
I know there's a way, we can leave today
Think it over and say, "I'm never going back again"

You were born in the little town
Before the awful sound started coming down
There's so much inside you that you won't let me see
You fly away from me, but it's an awful sound when you hit the ground
It's an awful sound when you hit the ground

I know there's a way, we can make them pay
Think it over and say, "I'm never going back again"
I know there's a way, we can leave today
Think it over

We know there's a price to pay for love in a reflective age
I met you up upon a stage, our love in a reflective age
Oh no, now you're gone
. 

Hey, Orpheus!
I'm behind you
Don't turn around
I can find you

Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through
And if I call for you
Oh, Orpheus!
Just sing for me all night
We'll wait until it's over
Wait until it's through

You say it's not me, it's you

Hey, Orpheus!
De l'autre côté de l'eau
Comme un écho
Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through

And if I shout for you
Never doubt
Don't turn around too soon
Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through

It seems so important now
But you will get over
It seems so important now
But you will get over
And when you get over
When you get older
Then you will remember
Why it was so important then

Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
When you get over
And when you get older
Then you will discover
That it's never over

Hey, Eurydice!
Can you see me?
I will sing your name
Till you're sick of me
Just wait until it's over
Just wait until it's through

But if you call for me
This frozen sea
It melts beneath me
Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through

Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
And when you get over
And when you get older
Then you will remember

He told you he'd wake you up
When it was over
He told you he'd wake you up
When it was over
Now that it's over
Now that you're older
Then you will discover
That it's never over

It's never over (it's never over) [8x]

Sometime (Sometime)
Sometime (Sometime)
Boy, they're gonna eat you alive (eat you alive)
But it's never gonna happen now
We'll figure it out somehow

Sometime (Sometime)
Sometime (Sometime)
Boy, they're gonna eat you alive (eat you alive)
But it's never gonna happen now
We'll figure it out somehow

Cause it's never over
It's never over (it's never over) [6x]

We stood beside
A frozen sea
I saw you out
In front of me
Reflected light
A hollow moon
Oh Orpheus, Eurydice
It's over too soon
. 

Take the makeup off your eyes
I've got to see you, hear your sacred sighs
Before the break up, comes the silence
I'm talking to you. You say you're over it,
But I know

I thought I knew you. You thought you knew me
But now that you do, it's not so easy now
That I know

You can cry; I won't go. You can scream; I won't go
Every man that you know would have run at the word go
Little boys with their porno, oh, I know they hurt you so
They don't know what we know. Never know what we know

And all your makeup, just take it all off
I've got to find you before the line is lost
I know I hurt you, I won't deny it
When I reach for you, you say, "I'm over it."
But I know

You can cry; I won't go. You can scream; I won't go
Every man that you know would have run at the word go
Little boys with their porno, oh, I know they hurt you so
They don't know what I know. It's so little that we know
But the cup it overflows. Little boys with their porno
This is their world, where can we go?

Makes me feel like something's wrong with me
Makes me feel like something's wrong with me
Can you see me?

You can cry; I won't go. You can scream; I won't go
Little boys with their porno. Little boys with their porno
Makes me feel like something's wrong. It's the only world we know
Yeah, something's wrong. Little boys with their porno

And boys they learn some selfish shit until the girl won't put up with it
On and on and on we go. I just have to know. I'm not over it
I'm not over it

So love is real like a disease. 
Come on tell me please, 
I'm not over it
I'm not over it
. 

Afterlife
Oh my God, what an awful word
After all the breath and the dirt and the fires are burnt
And after all this time, and after all the ambulances go
And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on in the dead lights
Of the afterglow

I’ve gotta know… 

Can we work it out?
If we scream and shout, ’till we work it out
Can we just work it out?
Scream and shout ’till we work it out
’till we work it out, ’till we work it out
’till we work it out, ’till we work it out

Afterlife
I think I saw what happens next
Oh, it was just a glimpse of you, like looking through a window
Or a shallow sea
Could you see me?
And after all this time
It’s like nothing else we used to know
And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on in the dead lights
Of the afterglow

I’ve gotta know…

Can we work it out?
If we scream and shout, ’till we work it out
Can we just work it out?
Scream and shout ’till we work it out?

But you say, “Oh, when love is gone
Where does it go?”
And you say,
“Oh, when love is gone
Where does it go?”
And where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?

And after this
Can it last another night?
After all the bad advice
That had nothing at all to do with life

I’ve gotta know...

Can we work it out?
If we scream and shout, ’till we work it out
Can we just work it out?
Scream and shout ’till we work it out?

But you say,
“Oh, when love is gone
Where does it go?”
And you say,
“Oh, when love is gone
Where does it go?”
We know it’s gone
But where did it go?
And where do we go?

Is this the afterlife?
It’s just an afterlife with you.
It’s just an afterlife.
It’s just an afterlife.
It’s just an afterlife with you.
It’s just an afterlife.
It’s just an afterlife.

I said I wanna be born
Born again
But not right now

Please don't take me there
But God said,
Son, it's time to go
But when you'll return 
I don't know just yet

But even stars they die when they get old
The precious ones that we used to hold
So if you gonna shoot you better hit your mark
Send that arrow,
Sent it through my heart
My heart

You said,
This time, I won't get turned away
This time, I won't get turned away
This time, I won't get turned away

Well, Joan of Arc
I walk in the dark
She said,
I've seen how the world ends
First they love you

Women of a certain age
Made to feel they gotta change
Some of them change their faces
But they don't smile the same
Some of them take night courses
Some of them get divorces
As the world gets strange
It's time for a change

Go and let your men get strange markings
Go and let the world get strange
Never change

Women own the world tonight
'Cause all the boys, they just wanna fight
And women of the world are born
To all the boys little wars
Mother, sister, daughter
The boys, they just can't father
It's time to take the ranks
When it's away from the strange

Go and let your men get strange markings
Go and let the world get strange
But never change
Never change
Never change

Soft power got them so upset.
They think it's over.
But it's not done yet.

Soft power in the underground
Gonna let the wind
Blow the shit all around.

Well,
Soft power gets into our brains
Soft power now it's never going to be the same
All your voices in the streets tonight
Soft power
It's alright

All your power makes the world go round
You can cut the speakers
You can cut all the sounds.
But can you hear us
Singing our song?
Soft power
Now it's coming on strong

Soft power gets into our brains
Soft power now it's never going to be the same
All your voices in the streets tonight
Soft power
It's alright

Look at them go
Soft power
They're about to explode
Soft power
In the Underworld
Soft power
Every boy and girl

We were born
So it's our right
You can cut all the power
You can cut all the lights
But we can see you even in the dark
Your words are fire
And we are the spark

Well
Soft power gets into our brains
Soft power now it's never, ever going to be the same
All your voices in the streets tonight
Soft power
It's not alright

On the twelfth of January
You don't need what you can't carry
The blood will flow into the ocean
The voices breaking with the motion

Crucified
Then crucified again
Crucified
Then crucified again

In the night, they started singin'
They had no right to keep believin'
But down bellow, there's someone screamin'
A broken church, no bells a-ringin'

They crucified
Then crucified again
They crucified
Then crucified again

Crucified again
Crucified again

The preachers talk on television
Hand out the judgments of their religion
But when I heard those women singin'
They made a sound I couldn't believe in

Crucified
Then crucified again

He who strikes the blow forgets it
But he who bears the scar remembers
The fire is burnin' down to embers
The fire is burnin', but I can't remember

Crucified
Then crucified again
Crucified
Then crucified again

Crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again, and again, and again

All you great and mighty nations
Who think you've payed for your high stations
The cities may be built in the sand
But ours were built by their fathers' hands

They crucified
Then crucified again

Crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again, and again, and again

Till the crowd cries
Do it again

Can't make it back again

We'll make it home again
From everything now

Every inch of sky's got a star
Every inch of skin's got a scar
I guess that you've got everything now
Every inch of space in your head
Is filled up with the things that you read
I guess you've got everything now
And every film that you've ever seen
Fills the spaces up in your dreams
That reminds me

(Everything now)
(Everything now)

Every inch of road's got a sign
And every boy uses the same line
I pledge allegiance to everything now
Every song that I've ever heard
Is playing at the same time, it's absurd
And it reminds me, we've got everything now
We turn the speakers up till they break
'Cause every time you smile it's a fake
Stop pretending, you've got...

(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I want it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!)
(Everything now!)
Everything now

Every inch of road's got a town
Daddy, how come you're never around?
I miss you, and everything now
Mama, leave the food on the stove
Leave your car in the middle of the road
This happy family with everything now
We turn the speakers up till they break
'Cause every time you smile it's a fake
Stop pretending, you've got...

(Everything now!) I need it
(Everything now!) I want it
(Everything now!) I can't live without
(Everything now!) I can't live without

(Everything now!) I can't live
(Everything now!) Every inch of space
(Everything now!) In my heart
(Everything now!) Is filled with something I'll never start

The ashes of everything now
And then you're black again
Can't make it back again
From everything now

Those cool kids
Stuck in the past
Apartments of cigarette ash
Wait outside until it begins
Won't be the first ones in

Spend your life waiting in life
You find it hard to define
But you do it every time
Then you do it again

Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again
Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again

First kiss tastes like cigarettes
Dead man walking take your bets
Once again you lost your friends
Around and around again

Those cool kids
Stuck in the past
Apartments of cigarette ash
"Where are we going?"
Who did you ask?

Friday, Saturday, sometimes Sunday
Love is hard, sex is easy
God in heaven, could you please me?

You think you invented life
You find it hard to define
But you do it every time

Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night

Still looking for signs of life (Signs of Life)

So we do it again
Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again

Some boys hate themselves
Spend their lives resenting their fathers
Some girls hate their bodies
Stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback

Saying
God, make me famous
If you can't just make it painless
Just make it painless

Assisted suicide
She dreams about dying all the time
She told me she came so close
Filled up the bathtub and put on our first record

Saying
God, make me famous
If you can't just make it painless
Just make it painless

It goes on and on, I don't know what I want
On and on, I don't know if I want it
On and on, I don't know what I want
On and on, I don't know if I want it
(On and on I don't know what I want)
(On and on I don't know if I want it)
(On and on I don't know what I want)
(On and on I don't know if I want it)

Some girls hate themselves
Hide under the covers with sleeping pills and
Some girls cut themselves
Stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback
Some boys get too much, too much love, too much touch
Some boys starve themselves
Stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback

Creature comfort makes it painless
Bury me penniless and nameless
Born in a diamond mine
It's all around you but you can't see it
Born in a diamond mine
It's all around you but you can't touch it

Saying
God, make me famous
If you can't just make it painless
Just make it painless

It's not painless
She was a friend of mine, a friend of mine
And we're not nameless, oh

It goes on and on, I don't know what I want
On and on, I don't know if I want it
On and on, I don't know what I want
On and on, I don't know if I want it
(On and on I don't know what I want)
(On and on I don't know if I want it)
(On and on I don't know what I want)
Well if you're not sure, better safe than sorry

Creature comfort, make it painless
Creature comfort, make it painless

We're the bones under your feet
The white lie of American prosperity
We wanna dance but we can't feel the beat
I'm a liar, don't doubt my sincerity

Just make it painless
Creature comfort, make it painless

Na-na-na-na na-na-na
Na-na-na-na na-na-na
(Na-na-na-na na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na na-na-na)
Creature comfort, make it painless

In my dreams you're dying
It wakes me up, and I can't stop crying
I just wanna live forever
Keep my promises, keep it together
In my dreams you're living
Open your eyes, and I wake up forgiven
Just a little something to thin the blood
How can I live with so much love?
Singing

Be my Wendy, I'll be your Peter Pan
Come on baby, take my hand
We can walk if you don't feel like flying
We can live, I don't feel like dying
Be my Wendy, I'll be your Peter Pan
Come on baby, ain't got no plans
Boys and girls got all the answers
Men and women keep growing their cancers
Singing

In my dreams we're kissing
It wakes me up, but you've gone missing
Born so close, but we grow apart
And all the sickness starts in the heart
In my dreams you're dying
It wakes me up, and I can't stop crying
'Cause it's a date night, dead-eyed American dream
And it leaves you baby, if you let it leave
Singing

Be my Wendy, I'll be your Peter Pan
Come on baby, take my hand
We can walk if you don't feel like flying
We can live, I don't feel like dying
Be my Wendy, I'll be your Peter Pan
Come on baby, ain't got no plans
Just a little something to thin the blood
How can I live with so much love?
Singing

Summer's gone and so are you
See the sky electrocute
A thousand boys that look like you
Cover my eyes electric blue

Now I can't get my head around it

You want to get messed up?
When the times get rough
Put your favourite record on baby
And fill the bathtub up
You want to say goodbye
To your oldest friends

With the good God damn
With the good God damn

Lay out your clothes
It's time to go
It's always darkest before the dawn
The sun never shows
I could say goodbye
To your oldest friends

Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Could there be a good God? damn
Could there be a good God? damn
Maybe there's a good God
Damn

Let me get messed up?
When the times get rough
Put your favourite record on baby
Fill the bathtub up
You could say goodbye
To your sick old friends

Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn

Put your money on me
'Cause I can barely breathe
Put your money on me

Put your money on me
If you think I'm losing you, you must be crazy
All your money on me
I'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
Put your money on me
Or tuck me into bed, and wake me when I'm dead
I know that you gotta be free
But I'm never gonna let it go

If there was a race, a race for your heart
It started before you were born
Above the chloroform sky
Clouds made of ambien
Sitting on carpets in the basement of Heaven
We were born innocent, but it lasts a day
And baby you can give all the money away
But if there's a race, a race for your heart
It's over before it starts
Singing

Put your money on me
If you think I'm losing you, you must be crazy
All your money on me
I'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
Put your money on me
Or tuck me into bed, and wake me when I'm dead
I know that you gotta be free
But I'm never gonna let it go

All my presents are broken before they're open
And the promises, the second they're spoken
I know I've been different
My skin keeps shedding
My mother was crying on the day of our wedding
Trumpets of angels call for my head
I fight through the ether and I'll quit when I'm dead
If you want to know who'll be there in the end
When you bury me, baby, I'll still be your friend
Singing

Put your money on me
If you think I'm losing you, you must be crazy
All your money on me
I'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
Put your money on me
Or tuck me into bed, and wake me when I'm dead
I know that you gotta be free
But I'm never gonna let it go

Singing put your money on
All your money on me
Put your money on
I know it's not the last time
Put your money on
All your money on
Put your money on
I know it's not easy

(To put your money on me)
('Cause I can barely breathe)
(When you put your money on me)
When Silicon Valley's melted back into silicon
We'll find a way to survive
Singing

Put your money on me
If you think I'm losing you, you must be crazy
All your money on me
I'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
Put your money on me
Or tuck me into bed, and wake me when I'm dead
I know that you gotta be free
But I'm never gonna let it go

Singing put your money on
All your money on me
Put your money on
I know it's not the last time
Put your money on
All your money on
Put your money on
I know it's not easy
To put your money on
All your money on me
Put your money on
I know it's not the last time
Put your money on
All your money on me
Put your money on
I know it's not easy

Keep both eyes on the road tonight
'Cause I'm driving home to you
A terrible song on the radio
Baby what else is new?

You don't want to talk
You don't want to touch
You don't even wanna watch TV
You say I can't see the forest for the trees
So burn it all down, and bring the ashes to me

Keep both eyes on the road tonight
'Cause God knows where I've been
Officer please, don't check my breath
That ain't my only sin

You don't want to talk
You don't want to touch
You don't even wanna watch TV
If you can't see the forest for the trees
Just burn it all down, and bring the ashes to me

Keep you waiting, hour after hour
Every night, in your lonely tower
Looking down at all of the wreckage
When we met, you'd never expect this
And you said, maybe we don't deserve love
Maybe we don't deserve love
Maybe we don't deserve love
We don't deserve
We don't deserve love
Maybe we don't deserve love

Keep both eyes on the road tonight
'Cause I'm driving home to you
Terrible song on the radio
Baby what else is new?
Been hiding my scars in broad daylight bars
Behind laugh tracks on TV
If you can't see the forest for the trees
Just burn it all down, and bring the ashes to me

Keep you waiting, hour after hour
Every night, in your lonely tower
Looking down at all the wreckage
When we met you'd never expect this
And you say, maybe we don't deserve love
Keep you waiting, hour after hour
Every night, in your lonely tower
Looking down at all the wreckage
When we met you'd never expect this
And you say, maybe we don't deserve love
Maybe we don't deserve love
Maybe we don't deserve love
We don't deserve
We don't deserve love
(We don't deserve love)

Mary, roll away the stone
The men that you love
Always leave you alone
Well go on Mary
Roll away the stone
The men you love always leave you alone
You hear your mother screaming
You hear your daddy shouting
You try to figure it out
You never figured it out
Your mother's screaming
That you don't deserve love
If you don't deserve love
And if I don't deserve love
What could we deserve?
Come down off your cross
And tell me!
It's always the Christ-types
Mary, roll away the stone
The one that you love
Always gonna leave you alone
Particularly the Christ-types
Mary, roll away the stone
The one you love
Always leave you alone
It's always the Christ-types
You're waiting on

I'm in the black again
Not coming back again
We can just pretend
We'll make it home again
From everything now

I'm in the red again
Red space in my head again
We can just pretend
We'll make it home again
From everything now

Abraham took Isaac's hand and led him to the lonesome hill.
While his daughter hid and watched,
She dare not breathe, she was so still.
Just as an angel cried for the slaughter,
Abraham's daughter raised her voice.

Then the angel asked her what her name was,
She said, "I have none."
Then he asked, "How can this be?"
"My father never gave me one."

And with his sword up, raised for the slaughter,
Abraham's daughter raised her bow.
"How darest you, child, defy your father?"
"You better let young Isaac go."

Run run run run run run run away
Run run run run run run run away from me from me

You breath like airs a tourist in your heart babe
When colder weather comes you'll just suffocate

You kiss like love's a tourist in your heart babe
When colder weather comes you just disappear from me
But I cant wait to have your sweet love again before you

Run run run run run run run away
Run run run run run run run away from me from me

You breath like airs a tourist in your heart babe
When colder weather comes you'll just suffocate

You kiss like love's a tourist in your heart babe
When colder weather comes you just disappear from me
But I cant wait to have your sweet love again

You're cold blooded, stealin' my sunlight
You're cold blooded alligator mine

You're cold blooded, stealin' my sunlight
You're cold blooded alligator mine

You run away again my
I wont stay alligator mine

Burning bridges, breaking hearts
Everything you taught us to do
We're burning bridges, and breaking hearts
No home to come home to
We're burning bridges, and breaking hearts
I won't look you in the eye
And burning bridges, breaking hearts
Caught you in a friendship lie

Took a visit, to your old house
The windows were all boarded up
Try to hold these, memories
The ocean in a paper cup
There's no future in this town
They barricade the buildings there
To the lion, you've been cast
Only bones are gonna last

There's a city, underground
There's a city made of glass
There's a city, underground
Hurry cause it's breaking fast

There's no future in this town
They barricade the buildings there
We're burning bridges and breaking hearts
No home to come home to

We're burning bridges
(and breaking hearts)
We're burning bridges
(and breaking hearts)
Burning bridges, breaking hearts
(breaking hearts)

Burning bridges, breaking hearts
Everything you taught us to do
We're burning bridges and breaking hearts
No home to come home to

We're burning bridges and breaking hearts
Everything you taught us to do
We're burning bridges and breaking hearts
No home to come home to
. 

Where we gonna go 
I'm gassed up, I'm ready to go
Grab your jacket, Let's hit the road
We can't wait any longer, Let's go

She's looking out the window
And her baby starting to show 
From five months ago 
So keep driving, keep driving through the snow

I passed by my folks on side of the road, but I'm through it everyone
We can't let go, You can't let go of the wheel
And I pass by my friends on either end, But I'm through it all of them
I can't let go, We can't let go of the wheel

Hoping land for miles is Nebraska in my eye
And we still crystallize
Any longer any longer 

Trees and power lines are all dressed in the ice
And we still crystallize 
Keep moving keep moving through the eye

See the road swallow us whole, and we're still alive...
But I cant let go, I cant let go of the wheel
And water break on a burning wick and douse the flame kill her quiver 
We cant let go, We cant let go of eachother
Shes crying saying it's nobody's fault, shes already a pillar of salt
We're too dissolved, we're too dissolved into the road
. 

I read the pages about me
In her autobiography
They were brief and to the point

Our flesh, while you are getting dressed
A memory that needs to be repressed
I'll just wait until it's over

Since you've gone away I never know just what to say
Since you've gone away I never know just what to say

Cause I like cars more than telephones
Your voice in my ear makes me feel so alone
Tonight I'm gonna drive, the silver moon is shining bright
Over the interstate, God saying hurry don't be late
Soon the sun will rise, that's when the romance dies
And I'm just tired of running around

I walked to get the mail today
I guess your letter never came
I'll just check again tomorrow

A flash while you are getting dressed
A memory that needs to be repressed
I'll just wait without saying a word

Since you've gone away I never know just what to say
Since you've gone away I never know just what to say

Cause I like cars more than telephones
Your voice in my ear makes me feel so alone
Tonight I'm gonna drive, the silver moon is shining bright
Over the interstate, God saying hurry don't be late
Soon the sun will rise, that's when the romance dies
And I'm just tired of running around

But fuck it, I love you even if, I'm gonna feel like shit
By the time I get to you, now the sky is turning blue

The stars they disappear one by one as the daylight nears
And yes you're in my head, but that doesn't make you here

And I've lost all my friends, but you're the one I miss the most
And now I'm almost there, yeah, I'm almost to the coast

And if I had any notion of how I'm gonna drive my car across
The Atlantic Ocean I'd be fucking set
. 

In the middle of the summer
I'm not sleeping cold wind blowing
In the middle of the night
They try to find me but I'm still driving

If you're going to San Francisco
Lay some flowers on the grave stone
There's music on the station
And I'm just listening to cold wind whistling
And if they ever find me
Tell the papers cold wind, cold wind
Cold, cold wind blowing
Cold wind blowing

Hey hey hey

Something ain't right
Something ain't right
And if they ever find me
Tell the papers cold wind, cold wind
Cold, cold wind blowing
Cold wind blowing
Cold wind blowing
Cold wind blowing
Cold wind blowing

When Lenin was little
All the birds in the boat were singing, "Man this is it"
Now that he's older
All the sailors in heaven are singing up and shit

I know it can't be right
I know it can't be right
But I just smile instead
Of repeating what I say in my head

When Lenin was little
He stung like a vampire on all hollows eve
All the saints of heaven
Looking down at the leaves falling off the tree

I know it can't be right
I know it can't be right
But I just smile instead
Of repeating what I say

Daddy, daddy, please spare the world
From the government
Daddy, daddy, please spare my soul
From my judgment

Daddy, daddy, please send me a heart
That is made of cement
'Cause the money's all been spent

Daddy, daddy, please spare the world

Sunlight loves me, feeds me milk and honey
Daytime misses me, feeds me milk and honey

It's a shame about the roadblock
We're afraid that we'll get caught or stopped
Let's go right now, surf city eastern block
I'm in the trunk, my surfboard on top

The eighties ain't been kind to anyone
I just want to find myself some sun
It's 1984, I'm on the run
Goodbye Berlin, hello Autobahn

It's a shame about the roadblock
If they catch us we won't ever talk
Let's go right now, surf city eastern block
I'm in the trunk when the inspector knocks

I see the lightning almost every day
I've stopped pretending its a bird of prey

My little brother's got a strange disease
he gives a name to everything he sees

ABC, DO RE MI, KKK, NAACP
USA, DOA, NYC, RIP

We heard the thunder on your daddy's farm
your momma said it was a fire alarm
the neighbors heard it and they started to run
we were deciding what to name our son

Let's call that son of a bitch

ABC, DO RE MI, KKK, NAACP
USA, DOA, NYC, RIP

The years is...
(shout out any year that comes into your head, its all the dark)

I lay on my back in the lake at night in the summer time trying to remember
Every last second, every last breath that I spent with you
The yellow dotted line, reflected in your eyes
You scream as the crickets fly in the open window
Please don't cry love

Come on babe, we both know that I'll stay
The Virgin Mary lives beside the highway
Let's go and see her
Let's ask her blessings today

We've both felt love before even if we deny it
That familiar feeling of believing that we'll die without it
But we never do, well not completely

Come on babe, we both know that I'll stay
The Virgin Mary lives beside the highway
Let's go and see her lets ask her blessings today

You know I'm adrift without you
Come on home, you know I still feel it
Yeah

You know I'm adrift without you
Come on home, you know I still feel it
Yeah

William Pierce Butler, my little brother
I know I treat you bad, I know I'm like our dad
When I get scared it's in the air

William Pierce come here, I know I'm insincere
When I am with my friends, love breaks it never ends
I'll love you when you're trapped in sin and doubt
Lets get out! lets get out!

William Pierce we're old, living far from home
Don't lose your light in a crowd, shining without a doubt
For all the world, for all the world and me to see
Don't follow me
Not me
Not me
Not me
