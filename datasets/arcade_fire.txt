Our heads are just houses 000 Without enough windows 000 You say you hear human voices 000 But they're only echoes 000  000 They're only echoes 000 They're only echoes 000 Only echoes 000  000 [x3:] 000 We are not asleep, 000 We are in the streets 000 .  000  000 Now that San Francisco's gone, 000 I guess I'll just pack it in. 000 Wanna wash away my sins, 000 In the presence of my friends. 000  000 You and I we head back East, 000 To find a town where we can live. 000 Even in the half light, 000 We can see that something's gotta give. 000  000 When we watched the markets crash, 000 The promises we made were torn 000 Then my parents sent for me, 000 From out West where I was born. 000  000 Some people say, we've already lost, 000 But they're afraid to pay the cost for what we've lost. 000 Pay the cost for what we've lost 000  000 Now that you have left me here, 000 I will never raise my voice. 000 All the diamonds you have here, 000 In this home which has no life. 000  000 Oh, this city's changed so much 000 Since I was a little child. 000 Pray that God won't live to see 000 The death of everything that's wild. 000  000 Though we knew this day would come, 000 Still it took us by surprise. 000 In this town where I was born, 000 I now see through a dead man's eyes. 000  000 One day they will see it's long gone. 000 One day they will see it's long gone. 000 One day they will see it's long gone. 000 One day they will see it's long gone. 000 .  000  000 Let's go for a drive 000 And see the town tonight 000 There's nothing to do but I don't mind when I'm with you 000  000 This time's so strange 000 They built it to change 000 And while we're sleeping all the streets, they rearrange. 000  000 And my old friends, we were so different then 000 Before your war against the suburbs began 000 Before it began 000  000 And now the music divides 000 Us into tribes 000 You grew your hair so I grew mine 000 You said the past won't rest 000 Until we jump the fence 000 And leave it behind 000  000 And my old friends, I can remember when 000 You cut your hair 000 I never saw you again 000 Now the cities we live in 000 Could be distant stars 000 And I search for you 000 In every passing car 000  000 The night's so warm 000 Yeah, the night's so warm 000 I've been living in the shadows of your song 000 Living in the shadows of your song 000  000 In the suburbs I, 000 I learned to drive 000 And you told me we would never survive 000 So grab your mother's keys we leave tonight 000  000 But you started a war 000 That you can't win 000 They keep erasing all the streets we grew up in 000  000 Now the music divides 000 Us into tribes 000 You choose your side and I'll choose my side 000  000 All my old friends, they don't know me now 000 Oh-oh 000 All my old friends, are staring through me now 000 Oh-oh 000 All my old friends, they don't know me now 000 All my old friends, they don't know me now 000  000 All my old friends wait 000 .  000  000 One two

 000 Month of May, it's a violent thing 000 In the city their hearts start to sing 000 Well, some people sing, 000 It sounds like they're screaming 000 Used to doubt it 000 But now I believe it 000  000 Month of May, everybody's in love 000 Then the city was hit from above 000 And just when I knew what I wanted to say 000 A violent wind blew the wires away 000  000 We were shocked in the suburbs 000  000 Now the kids are all standing with their arms folded tight 000 Kids are all standing with their arms folded tight 000 Well, some things are pure and some things are right 000 But the kids are still standing with their arms folded tight 000 I said some things are pure and some things are right 000 But the kids are still standing with their arms folded tight 000  000 So young, so young 000 So much pain for someone so young, well 000 I know it's heavy, I know it ain't light 000 But how you gonna lift it with your arms folded tight? 000  000 First the built the road, then they built the town 000 That's why we're still driving around 000 And around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around 000  000 Two-thousand nine, two-thousand ten 000 Wanna make a record how I felt then 000 When we stood outside in the month of May 000 And watched the violent wind blow the wires away 000  000 If I die in the month of May 000 Let the wind take my body away, yeah 000 I wish I may, I wish I might 000 Don't lay me down there with my arms folded tight 000  000 Start again in the month of May 000 Start again in the month of May 000 Come on and blow the wires away

000 Spent the summer staring out the window 000 The wind it takes you where it wants to go 000  000 First they built the road, then they built the town 000 That's why we're still driving around and around 000 And all we see 000 Are kids in buses longing to be free 000  000 Wasted hours, before we knew 000 Where to go, and what to do 000 Wasted hours that you make new 000 And turn into 000 A life that we can live 000  000 Some cities make you lose your head 000 Endless suburbs stretched out thin and dead 000 And what was that line you said? 000  000 Wishing you were anywhere but here 000 You watch the life you're living disappear 000 And now I see 000 We're still kids in buses 000 Longing to be free 000  000 Wasted hours, before we knew 000 Where to go, and what to do 000 Wasted hours, that you make new 000 And turn into 000 A life that we can live 000 .  000  000 Here 000 In my place and time 000 And here in my own skin 000 I can finally begin 000 Let the century pass me by 000 Standing under night sky 000 Tomorrow means nothing 000  000 I was only a child then 000 Feeling barely alive when 000 I heard a song from the speaker of a passing car 000 And prayed to a dying star 000 The memory's fading 000 I can almost remember singing 000 La la, la la la la la 000 La la, la la, la la la la 000  000 We watched the end of the century 000 Compressed on a tiny screen 000 A dead star collapsing and we could see 000 That something was ending 000 Are you through pretending 000 We saw the signs in the suburbs? 000  000 You could never predict it 000 That it could see through you
